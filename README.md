Code sharing for final project--- draft of paper maintained on sharelatex

Working Topic: Comparison of dimensionality reduction techniques across a particular data type

LITERATURE:

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05830v2.pdf --> using Places2 dataset to train scene recognition/identification model; we note that this is based on convolutional neural networks + relay backpropagation, which (from a cursory analysis/web search) seems to be the prevailing method in CV for this problem.
